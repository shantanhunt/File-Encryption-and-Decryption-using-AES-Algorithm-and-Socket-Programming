# File-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-Algorithm-and-Socket-Programming-
This Repository Demonstrates File Encryption using AES algorithm. The Client Encrypts the File using a password and sends it to the Server to Decrypt it.

To Encrypt the file from the Client side and to send it to the Server side for Decrypt the file follow the following steps-
- Clone this repository using the git clone command
- Go into the Server-Side directory and run the Server.py file
- Go into the Client-Side directory and run the Client.py file
- Enter any Password to Encrypt the file from the Client
- Go to the Server and enter the same password to decrypt the contents of the file into Fileout 

Note: You would need two terminals running at the same time to run this code correctly. One for client and one for the server.
